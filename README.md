# The TUHH LaTeX Beamer Presentation Template Project
The Hamburg University of Technology launched a new Brand Identity on 17.11.2021.  
To unify the visual representation of the TUHH, a style guide, PowerPoint templates and additional materials were designed.  
As LaTeX is still in heavy use for scientific typesetting and document creation, this project aims to translate the available PowerPoint templates to an equivalent Beamer class.  
It has to be noted, that this project is conducted in a purely complementary nature.  
Furthermore, LaTeX and in particular Beamer templates are complex, convoluted and delicate pieces of code.  
Since we do not have any professional background in LaTeX template design, bugs, inconsistencies, and errors might very well occur.

We are confident that the template produces presentations in accordance with the new brand identity.  
You can have a look at the current template by clicking the demo button at the top.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to contact us, open issues, or implement features and create merge request.  
**We are happy for any input we can get!**

# How to get started:
You can get the newest version of the template by
- cloning the repository,
- or downloading a [release](https://collaborating.tuhh.de/e-4/tuhh_latex_presentation/-/releases) version.

# How to use it:
1. Copy the template files to your presentation folder. Thoses are :
    - the [tuhh_presentation.cls](./tuhh_presentation.cls) file
    - the [beamercolorthemetuhh.sty](./beamercolorthemetuhh.sty) file
    - the [beamerfontthemetuhh.sty](./beamerfontthemetuhh.sty) file
    - the [beamerinnerthemetuhh.sty](./beamerinnerthemetuhh.sty) file
    - the [beamerouterthemetuhh.sty](./beamerouterthemetuhh.sty) file
    - the [beamerthemetuhh.sty](./beamerthemetuhh.sty) file
    - the [tuhh_theme](./tuhh_theme) folder and its content
2. Use `demo_tuhh_presentation.tex` as a starting point
3. Adapt meta-data such as `\date`, `\author`, `\institute`, `\telephonenumber`
4. Add your own slides

Finally, for a more convenient setup of the presentation you may use the provided [`copy_themes_files.py`](./copy_themes_files.py) python script:`./copy_themes_files.py new/presentation/dir`.
