# The TUHH LaTeX Beamer Presentation Template Project
The Hamburg University of Technology launched a new Brand Identity on 17.11.2021.  
To unify the visual representation of the TUHH, a style guide, PowerPoint templates and additional materials were designed.  
As LaTeX is still in heavy use for scientific typesetting and document creation, this project aims to translate the available PowerPoint templates to an equivalent Beamer class.  
It has to be noted, that this project is conducted in a purely complementary nature.  
Furthermore, LaTeX and in particular Beamer templates are complex, convoluted and delicate pieces of code.  
Since we do not have any professional background in LaTeX template design, bugs, inconsistencies, and errors might very well occur.

We are confident that the template produces presentations in accordance with the new brand identity.  
You can have a look at the current template by clicking the demo button at the top.
